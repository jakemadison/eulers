# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 
# 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#decrement down from max, find a palindrome, then good!
#how many elements are left? if 3 or more, compare 1st and last elem
#send the string without first and last elems to same function
